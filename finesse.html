    <h1>Major keys to ~finessing~ college</h1>
    <h2>1. First off, we have finessing academics.</h2>
    <section>

      <h2>1. GETTING THE BAG (an A)</h2>
      <p>
        1. When it comes down to it, pain is temporary, but GPA is forever. I'm gonna let you in on the steps to getting that A!! 
        If you only absorb one thing from this, just know that the major key is being freinds with your GSI. That being said, office hours are a must. You take that time 
        out of your schedule and see them!! They will (most often) be the one's grading your hw/projects/lab whatever, so if they know 
        who you are, it is already a plus. 
        <div>2. A GOOD STUDY SPACE!! With the rona this is obvioulsy hard. Your study space could even consist of 
        noise cancelling headphones, so if someone talks to you, you can ignore them (pretend you don't hear lol)
        Also these can be $$, look at Ebay or secondhand. </div>
     <div> 3. Last but not least, KNOW someone who has taken your class (or a class similar to the subject) !! This is very important because 
         if you need any specific advice, they can be your go to person. Such as "what consists exaclty as a lot of participation??" This person 
        can help you with questions like these.  </div>

    <h2>Now, onto finessing the snacky snacks.</h2>

      <h2>2. GETTING FREE FOOD WHEN YOU'RE BROKE!</h2>
      <p>
        You may not think you are broke right now because you saved up money for college, but you will be. The amount of times 
        that I went out to eat thinking I would never need to because of the dining hall, is an absurd amount of times. That being said, utilize the 
        dining hall food to the best of your ABILITY. Get a MINI FRIDGE, and instead of buying snacks bring all the cereal from the 
        dining hall in a plastic bag and eat THAT when your hungry. Also, hide the fruit (apples/banans) in your pocket leaving the dining hall 
        for a nice healthy study snack.

    <h1>FINNESSING social life!! </h1>
    <section>

      <h2>3. GET BOYS TO SIMP FOR YOU  </h2>
      <p>This section has to do with finessing the social life in college. The way to have guys simpy for you (I am an expert in the guy region not the girls unfortunately...so my knowledge only goes so far!) is to do absolutely nothing. 
          Showing them your extreme disinterest will have them wondering why is she such A ~MYSTERY~ . When you finesse them this 
          also means more invites to things, which means bringing your friends to more things, and getting more free stuff in general! We love free stuff 
          so just make sure to put in the bare minimum effort possible.
